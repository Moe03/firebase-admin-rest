### **Firebase Admin REST API wrapper that works on Vercel edge functions, Bun, cloudflare workers, Deno or any JS runtime.**

### Why
- This main reason for the creation of this is to provide a common SDK that can be used in any JS environment without problems.
- The official firebase-admin sdk doesn't work on edge functions, bun, workers, deno and sometimes this can be a deal breaker.
- We have also implemented helper functions that helped our team internally with other problems as well
